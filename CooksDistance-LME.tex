\section{Cook's Distance for LMEs} %1.10
Diagnostic methods for fixed effects are generally analogues of methods used in classical linear models.
Diagnostic methods for variance components are based on `one-step' methods.
% \citet{cook86} 
\textit{Cook (1986)} gives a completely general method for assessing the influence of local departures from assumptions in statistical models.

For fixed effects parameter estimates in LME models, the \index{Cook's distance} Cook's distance can be extended to measure influence on these fixed effects.

\[
\mbox{CD}_{i}(\beta) = \frac{(c_{ii} - r_{ii}) \times t^2_{i}}{r_{ii} \times p}
\]

For random effect estimates, the \index{Cook's distance} Cook's distance is

\[
\mbox{CD}_{i}(b) = g{\prime}_{(i)} (I_{r} + \mbox{var}(\hat{b})D)^{-2}\mbox{var}(\hat{b})g_{(i)}.
\]
Large values for Cook's distance indicate observations for special attention.

\subsection{Change in the precision of estimates}

The effect on the precision of estimates is separate from the effect on the point estimates. Data points that
have a small \index{Cook's distance}Cook's distance, for example, can still greatly affect hypothesis tests and confidence intervals, if their  influence on the precision of the estimates is large.
