BXc2008 describes the sampling method when discussing of a motivating example

Diabetes patiens attending an outpatient clinic in Denmark have their HbA_{1c} levels routinely measured at every visit.

Venous and Capillary blood samples were obtained from all patients appearing at the clinic over two days.

Samples were measured on four consecutive days on each machines, hence there are five analysis days.

BXC notes that every machine was calibrated every day to  the manufacturers guidelines.

measurements are classified by method, individual and replicate. In this case the replicates are clearly not exchangeable, neither within patients
nor simulataneously for all patients.

In many cases, repeated observation are collected from each subject in sequence  and/or longitudinally.
