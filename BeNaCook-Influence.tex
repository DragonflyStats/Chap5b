% Diagnostics for Mixed-Model Analysis of Variance

% Abstract:
% We describe a new method for assessment of model inadequacy in maximum-likelihood mixed-model analysis of variance. 
% In particular, we discuss its use in diagnosing perturbations from the usual assumption of constant error variance and 
% from the assumption that each realization of a given random factor has been drawn from the same normal population. 
% Computer implementation of the procedure is described, and an example is presented, involving the analysis of filter 
% cartridges used with commercial respirators.
