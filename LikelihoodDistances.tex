	\[  LD(\boldsymbol{\omega}= 2[ L\boldsymbol{\hat{theta}} - \boldsymbol{\hat{theta}_\omega} \]
	
	Large values indicate that $\boldsymbol{\hat{theta}}$ and $\boldsymbol{\hat{theta}_\omega}$ differ considerably.

\section{Likelihood Distance} %1.11
The likelihood distance gives the amount by which the log-likelihood of the full data changes if one were
to evaluate it at the reduced-data estimates. The important point is that $l(\psi_{(U)})$ is not the log-likelihood
obtained by fitting the model to the reduced data set.

It is obtained by evaluating the likelihood function based on the full data set (containing all n observations) at the reduced-data estimates.

The likelihood distance is a global, summary measure, expressing the joint influence of the observations in
the set $U$ on all parameters in $\psi$  that were subject to updating.

\subsection{Likelihood Distance}

The \index{likelihood distance} likelihood distance is a global, summary measure, expressing the joint influence of the observations in the set $U$ on all parameters in $\phi$  that were subject to updating.
