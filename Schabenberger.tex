\citet{HaslettDillane} offers an
procedure to assess the influences for the variance components
within the linear model, complementing the existing methods for
the fixed components. The essential problem is that there is no
useful updating procedures for $\hat{V}$, or for $\hat{V}^{-1}$.
\citet{HaslettDillane} propose an alternative , and
computationally inexpensive approach, making use of the
`delete=replace' identity.

\citet{Haslett99} considers the effect of `leave k out'
calculations on the parameters $\beta$ and $\sigma^{2}$, using
several key results from \citet{HaslettHayes} on partioned
matrices.
